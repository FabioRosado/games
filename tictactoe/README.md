# TIC TAC TOE

This is a first attempt at creating a tic tac toe game out of thin air.
It uses a lot of if-elif statements but very few loops. 

The game also implements a very simple AI for the non-player oponent and it doesn't take in consideration moves that the player can do to win the game. So the player almost always wins the game.

Things that I might add in the future:
- Workin initial menu (letting you to choose who goes first, if you want to play with a pc oponent or with someone else)
- Showing a message to say who won the game
